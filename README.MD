This project was created for fun and for those who looking for better chart interfaces for bitcoin.
In my experience most of the options available such as coinmarketcap, show a lot of irrelevant information
for the average user, which can be confusing.
Most investors in the crypto market hold bitcoin and I believe most people want a simple and clear chart
to easily see the behaviour of the bitcoin market so they can make better decisions.

I hope this is helpful to someone out there, please leave some feedback, so I can work on improving
this App over time. Thanks
